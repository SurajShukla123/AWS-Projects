Project 3: EBS-Snapshots Cleanup

Removing EBS Snapshots, Which are older than 30 days

1.  By using Lambda function and boto3 SDK with appropriate IAM role

Step 1: Write Lambda Function (Python)

Create a new Python file, e.g., cleanup_function.py.

Write the Lambda function code.

##python code is there snap_python.py

This function uses the Boto3 library to interact with AWS services. It lists all Snap, checks if they are attached to any volume, and deletes the ones that are older than 30 days.

Step 2: 

2.Create an IAM Role for Lambda

Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the IAM service.

Create a new role with the "AWS Lambda" service as the trusted entity. Attach the AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole and AmazonEC2FullAccess policies.

Step 3: Create Lambda Function

Go to the AWS Lambda service in the AWS Management Console.

Click on "Create function."

Choose "Author from scratch."

Fill in the basic information:

Name: Enter a name for your function (e.g., SnapCleanupFunction).
Runtime: Choose the Python runtime.
In the "Function code" section, upload the Python file you created (cleanup_function.py).

In the "Execution role" section, choose "Use an existing role" and select the IAM role you created.

Click on "Create function."


Step 4: Test the Lambda Function

In the Lambda function console, click on "Test."

Create a new test event and run the test. Verify that the function executes successfully.


Step 5: Create CloudWatch Events Rule  - Optional

Go to the AWS CloudWatch service in the AWS Management Console.

Click on "Rules" in the left navigation pane.

Click on "Create rule."

Choose "Event Source" as "Event Source Type" and select "Schedule."

Configure the schedule expression (e.g., rate(1 day) for daily execution).

Add a target for the rule and select the Lambda function you created.

Click on "Configure details" and give your rule a name and description.

Click on "Create rule."
